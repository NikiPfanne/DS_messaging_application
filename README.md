# DS_messaging_application
A distributed messaging application built with a client–server architecture. Clients connect via TCP, while servers coordinate using UDP multicast. The system includes leader election (LeLann–Chang–Roberts), heartbeat-based fault detection, dynamic server discovery, and load balancing to ensure high availability and crash fault tolerance.
